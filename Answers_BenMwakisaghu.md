Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Ans: Software engineering is an engineering approach that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications. Software engineering is iterative in nature, where software is continuously improved based on user feedback while traditional engineering typically follows a more linear process, where designs are finalized before construction begins.

2. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Ans: Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning - This phase involves gathering business requirements from the client.
- Design - This phase involves designing the system, identifying the programming languages and platforms to be used and the security measures to be applied.
- Development - The development team turns the software requirements into code.
- Testing - This involves testing the software product to determine if it's functioning properly and it does what it was intended to.
- Deployment - This is when the final software product is delivered to the client.
- Maintenance - This phase involves fixing bugs and updating the deployed software.

3. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Ans: Key differences of Agile and Waterfall models of Sofware development, and the scenarios each might be preferred.

- In waterfall model, planning is done at the beginning of the project while in agile it's a continous process throughout the project's cycle. Changes are made as new information emerges.
- Agile is more adaptable to the project scope unlike waterfall which discourages since the project scope is defined at the beginning of the project cycle. Any changes made will be costly.
- Testing in agile is incremental to identify and resolve issues as they arise while in waterfall model, testing is done at specific milestones.
- Waterfall is suitable for longer timeframed projects while agile is suitable for short-term projects.
- Agile emphasizes on more informal communication unlike in waterfall where communication is more formal.

When to use Waterfall Model.

- Waterfall model is suitable when client's demands are clear and precise with no significant changes to the scope.

When to use Agile Model.

- Agile model is suitable when the end goal is unclear or difficult to define.

4. What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

- Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements.

Requirements Engineering Process

 - Feasibility Study: It is an assessment of the practicality of a proposed project.

 - Requirements elicitation : ways used to gain knowledge about the project requirements.

 - Requirements specification: This event is used to produce formal software requirement models. All the requirements including the functional, non-functional requirements and the constraints are specified by these models in totality.

 - Requirements for verification and validation : It is the process of checking if the requirements for a software system are complete, consistent, and accurate and that they meet the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.

 - Requirements management : It is the process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing, and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholders.

Importance of requirements engineering in the software development lifecycle.

- Well defined requirements helps the development team have clear project goals which will help them avoid miscommunication and ensuring everyone is aligned to the project expectations.
- Correctly defined requirements will inform the developers how a system should work and avoid mistakes while coding.
- It helps the testers easily verify if the system meets the user needs.


5) Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Ans: Concep of modularity and how it improves maintainability and scalability of software systems.

- Modularity in software design refers to dividing a system into separate, independent modules, each responsible for a distinct feature or functionality.

Benefits of Modularity

- Maintainability: Changes can be made to individual modules without impacting the entire system, making it easier to track and fix bugs without risking other parts of the system.
- Reusability: Modules designed for one project can often be used in another, saving development time and reducing errors by reusing proven code.
- Scalability: Modular systems can be easily scaled by adding new modules or enhancing existing ones without impacting the rest of the system.
- Parallel Development: Encourages collaboration. Different developers can work on different modules simultaneously, redusing the development time.

6) Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Ans: The different levels of software testing and why it is crucial in software development.

- Unit Testing: It is done at the code level and the program is submitted to assessments to ensure each component is fully functional.

- Integration Testing: This level of testing helps to identify bugs by combining multiple components within a program into groups.

- System Testing: This is the first level where the system is tested as a whole to determine if it meets the business requirements.

- Acceptance Testing: It is the final testing of the system to determine if the system is ready for release.

Importance of testing in Software Development

- Testing is very important since it helps reduce project risk, provide confidence in the software quality, ensures the software meets compliance needs and the users are satisfied, enabling continuous improvement, and reducing overall costs.

7) What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Ans: A version control system (VCS) tracks every modification to a file or set of files, enabling developers to go back to earlier versions and collaborate seamlessly without disrupting the other developers in the team.

Importance of Version Control Systems

- Encourages continous peer review which leads to significant improvement in code quality.

- It enables developers to collaborate which hels reduce the development time.

- A central repository enhances project transparency and accountability.

Examples of Popular Version Control Systems

Git
- Local branching
- Multiple workflows
- Convenient staging areas.

GitLab
- Integrated project.
- Project website.
- Automatically test and deliver the code.

Bitbucket
- Code branches.
- In-line commenting and discussions.
- Pull requests.
